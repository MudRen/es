	Introduction:
	-------------

Hi and welcome to Intermud Mailer Version 2.5!

This mailer was originally programmed by Huthar@portals, but this version
has been severely improved, bugfixed, and localized by Zak@Ivory.Tower.
Please send all bug reports or enhancement requests to that address! If
you need more information on how to go about doing this read on!

The intermud mailer was loosely based upon the BSD UNIX mailer that some
of you are already familiar with. To send mail you simply need to just
type 'mail <person>' (you may need to be in the Post Office if you
aren't a developer). <person> can be many things: a single
user, a list of users seperated by spaces, a group name, or even an
intermud users address! Here are some examples:

    mail zak				- Mail just to zak
    mail zak telsin vampyr 		- Mail to these three people
    mail (admin)			- Mail to all members of the admin group
    mail huthar@portal			- Mail to huthar on the mud Portals

Additionally you may mix and match these types to serve your purpses:

    mail zak (admin)@portals (develop) buddha@tmi-2

Typing 'mail' on it's own line will put you into the interactive mailer
where you can examine old mail, and perform other functions on your
mail box.


	Interactive Commands:
	----------- ---------

A variety of commands are available in interactive mode (entered by
just typing mail). A brief synopsis follows, with a more detailed
Explanation later:

   n, +, <CR>	read the next note.
   p, -		read the current note.
   # <num>	set current message # without displaying the mail.
   h <num>	list message headers starting at <num>. (Default is 1st).
   m [to [to]]	send a message to the list of to's (Separated by spaces).
   s <f> [<n>]	save then delete message <n> to file <f>. (Default is current)
   c <f> [<n>]	save (copy) message <n> to file <f>. (Default is current)
   r [<num>]	reply to message, including all to's and CC's.
   R [<num>]	reply to message, only to original mailer.
   g		list all groups that you can mail to.
   g <group>	list the members of group 'group'.
   a <g> <p>... Add list <p> to personal group <g>.
   A <g> <p>... Remove list <p> from personal group <g>.
   d [<num>]	delete current message or message <num>.
   u [<num>]	undelete current message or message <num>.
   f <d> [<n>]	forward a copy of message <n> to <d> (Default is current).
   q, x		quit the mailer. (All deleted mail will be removed)
   Q		quit the mailer without changes.
   ?		read the short help.
   $		re-read mailbox - useful if new mail has arrived.
   <num>	read the specified message #.


When the mailer starts up, a list of items in your mailbox will be
shown, with a sample line (with explanation):
	U >   2  Zak        (May 12 03:12)  RE: Your mailer...
	^ ^   ^   ^               ^             ^
	| |   |   |               |             | what it's about
	| |   |   |               | when they sent it
	| |   |   | who sent it
	| |   | message # in your mailbox
	| |   
	| | < == current item, deleted, > == current item, not deleted
	| | * == other item, deleted, <space> == normal
	|
	| U == unread, <space> == read

The `h' command will re-display this. If an argument is given to `h',
only items from the item number given will be shown.

Reading an item is achieved by pressing <RETURN> (if it's the current
item), or by entering its number. The `more' pager will be used if
necessary. The `current item' indicator will automatically be
incremented in any case (unless it's the last item.)

To make an item current without actually reading it, use `n <num>'.
Its complement, `p', will show you the current item number.

The `m' command can take arguments exactly in the same format as the
mailer (when started in `mail direct' mode). If no user is specified,
you will be prompted for a `To: ' line.

The `r' and `R' commands are for replying to a specific note. `r'
replies to all people who received the original, `R' replies only to
the original sender.

The `f' command is used to forward a copy of a message to a specific
person.

The `m', `r', and `R' commands will ask for a `Subject: ' line. For
`m', this defaults to `<no subject>'. For replies, it defaults to
`Re: <old_subject>' where <old_subject> is the subject of the item you
are replying to.

The editor will then be invoked. If you decide not to send, here is
the time to abort! (If you are using the `ed' mailer, the ed command
`Q' will abort.) Otherwise, enter your message and use the editor's
command to write & quit.

After you have finished the note, you may be asked to enter a `CC: '
line. Recipients entered here will also receive the mail.

Often, you may need to know members of a local group before actually
mailing to them. The groups that are currently available can be shown
with the `g' command, and the members of a specific group can be shown
with `g <groupname>'.

The concept of `personal groups' has been added to this version of the
mailer. A personal group is defined by you, and works much the same
as the system defined groups. To add people to a personal group, do
`a groupname pers1 ... persn'. Removing people is very similar:
`A groupname pers1 ... persn'.

Deleting items permanently is done with the `d' command. This will
flag that the current (or the specified) item is to be deleted upon
exiting the mailer with the normal quit commands. Restoring mail
(before quitting) is with the complementary command, `u'.

Developers who have home directories can save copies of mail into a
file with the `s' and `c' commands. A filename is required as the
first argument, and the default location to save is ~ (your home
directory) - NOT $CWD (current directory) as it is with most
commands. If the item number is not given, the current item is saved.
The `s' command will flag an item as `DELETED' after the successful
save, the `c' command will keep the status quo.

Exiting the mailer (this is the most important of all!) is with `q' or
`x'. This will delete all mail flagged as such, and also kill you.
Actually, I'm lying about the latter. The `Q' command will quit
without any changes (i.e, mail that was unread when you entered the
mailer will remain that way, even if you read it, and the `DELETED'
flag will be ignored).

If new mail arrives whilst in the mailer, (and you have set the option
to notify you of this), you can `re-syncronize' your mailbox with the
`$' command. This will act as if you entered `q' (to quit), and then
typed mail again - but it will be much faster. Mail flagged as deleted
WILL be removed!

Finally, simple help can be obtained by entering `?'. That will show
a file with a brief list of commands and their functions.


	Environment Variables / Customization:
	----------- --------- - --------------

Various functions of the mailer can be modified by the setting of
environment variables (with the `set' command at the normal command
prompt). These include:

mail_notification
	This option is basically 'biff' for you Unix people.  With this
	option set the mailer will inform you of all new mail as soon as
	it arrives at any time whilst playing.  Without this flag you will
	have to manually check to see if new mail has arrived.  Use the `$'
	command if you are inside the mailer to re-syncronize your
	mailbox (to show the new item in the headers list)

mail_no_cc
	Normally the mailer will prompt you for a list of people you
	would like to copy your message to after you finish entering
	it. (CC's take the same format as the to field).  Setting this
	environment variable flag will stop the force the mailer to not
	bother asking you. Many people like me just put everyone in the
	to line and don't want to bother with cc's.

mail_use_reply_text
	With this flag set the mailer will include the replied to mail
	message in any reply you make. The reply text is in the general
	usenet form. Here is an example, with my items added to the
	end:
	    Vampyr writes:
	    > zak,
	    >   get off your butt and finish the mailer docs. Back
	    > to work scum.
	    OK boss, it's installed now!
	      - Zak.

mail_entry_unread
	When you enter the mailer, the automatic headers listing will
	only show unread mail (useful for when you have a large
	mailbox).

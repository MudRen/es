Instructions for converting to Zak's v2.5 of the TMI-2 Mailer.


You need to do the following steps - preferably at a time when
your user load is low (or none :) Ensure you read through these
thoroughly before you attempt this.

- ensure you have the following files from TMI-2:
	/adm/daemons/ms.c
	/adm/daemons/mailer_d.c
	/adm/obj/mailer.c
	/adm/obj/convmail.c
	/cmds/file/_frm.c
	/cmds/file/_mail.c
- backup /adm/daemons/ms.c /adm/daemons/mailer_d.c /adm/obj/mailer.c
  /cmds/file/_mail.c
- remove ms.c & mailer.c, and destruct the objects (so they don't exist
  anymore). This helps stop mailbox corruption problems. if your bboard
  can mail notes, it might be an idea to edit send_message() in mailer_d
  and just return -1 or null or whatever justincase someone has some code
  which goes directly 
- edit <mailer.h>, add convmail as a trusted mailer, and change the MAIL_DIR
  to /data/oldmail. put convmail in /adm/obj or wherever
- update mailer_d.c (so accessing notes will access /data/oldmail)
- mv /data/mail /data/oldmail, mkdir /data/mail
- if your permissions have wierd checks on access to /data/mail, either
  run as ROOT_UID or hack yer permissions file.
- call /adm/obj/convmail;convert_directory;/data/oldmail;/data/mail
    (or your equivelant - that's the scroll command)
  This will run through and convert your mailboxes
- If you have problems, try temporarily renaming the offending mailbox
  to blahuser-DUMMY.o (from blahuser-mbox.o) and rerun the convertor
  til it works
- When it works, edit <mailer.h> and change MAIL_DIR back to /data/mail
- Install the new ms.c/mailer_d.c/mailer.c and update them.
- Install the new _mail.c and my _frm.c command
- Change your postoffice from code like:
	... // get args to add_action(mail) in `arg'
	... // clone mailer
	if (arg)
		MAILER->do_mail(arg);
	else
		MAILER->start_mail();

 to
	 MAILER->start_mail(arg);

- Update stuff, and try and run `mail'. Experiment around. Keep /data/oldmail
  until things appear to work OK.


NOTES:
- some mailboxes have problems - this is due to the inconsistant format that
  the old mailer had. So far, there have been no problems with mail actually
  _sent_ with the new system (although there were a couple of display bugs,
  etc, but I've fixed those :)
- if you have any major problems, mail zak@tmi-2 or ivory.tower, or Internet
  mail at <zak@rmit.edu.au>

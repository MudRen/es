Description of all the logs in /log, their purpose, and what parts of the
mudlib modify them:

BAD_FORCE           Used by force_me() in /std/body; if someone is forced to
                    execute a command that is not defined for them or is a
                    command that is not allowed to be forced, then the force
                    will fail and will be logged here.

BUGS                Keeps track of logged bugs in the mud. Objects that
                    affect this: /cmds/std/_praise, /cmds/adm/_clog, and
                    /cmds/xtra/_rlog.

FILES               Written by the file lock daemon (/adm/daemons/flock)
		    The file locking daemon allows a user to prevent some
		    other wizard from editing a file the user is currently
		    working on. All locks are logged here.

FORCES              Logged by /cmds/adm/_force. Keeps a list of all forces
                    that succeeded.

IDEAS               Log of ideas logged by users. Modifying files are
                    the same as those for BUGS.

KILLS               Written to whenever a player dies. The "killing" object
		    is logged too. Written to by /std/user.c.

MS                  Logs errors and other events by the mail server.

NEW_USER            Logged by /adm/daemons/newuserd - keeps track of all new
                    characters created.

PRAISES             Logs all praise reports. See BUGS for files that modify.

QUERIES             Logs all query reports. See BUGS for files that modify.

SHUTDOWN            Keeps a record of all game shutdowns, who initiated them,
                    and the reason why. Also logs failed shutdown attempts.
                    Written to by /cmds/adm/_shutdown.

TYPOS               Logs all typo reports. See BUGS for file that modify.

UPRECORD	    Keeps track of the time the MUD was started up: the
		    bottom entry is the start time of the current run.

UPSINCE             Contains the date and time the mud driver came up.

USAGE               Keeps track of login/logout/linkdeath/relogin/su.
                    Written to by /cmds/std/_su, /std/user, and
                    /adm/daemons/logind.

ZAPPED              Records all use of the zap command. Modified by
                    /cmds/wiz/_zap.

author_stats        Maintained by the driver.

cmwhod		    Logs the start of cmwho at load time.  

crashes             Written by the master object when the game crashes.

demotes             Logs all demotions. Written by /cmds/xtra/_demote.

domain_stats        Same as author_stats.

editing             Logs all use of the line editor 'ed'.

evals_calls         Logs all use of the eval and call commands. Modified
                    by /cmds/wiz/_eval and /cmds/refs/_call.

event_err           Keeps track of errors experienced by the event daemon
                    (/adm/daemons/event)

hibernate           Logs use of the hibernate command (/cmds/std/_hibernate)

hist_err	    Logs attempts to query a user's command history by any
		    object other than ROOT UID or the user himself. Such
		    queries can be used to build spies if not prevented.
		    Written to by /std/user/history.c.

inetd               Logs errors with the intermud server.

master_errors       Logs errors encountered by the master object. For example,
                    if a wizard rm'd their log file and created a dir
                    called log and then loaded a bad object, this would cause
                    the driver to crash. This no longer crashes, but is
                    here, as are other problems too. Written by
                    /adm/obj/master.

promotes            Logs all promotions in domains. Logged by
                    /cmds/xtra/_sponsor. See also 'sponsors'

sponsors            Logs all sponsorships into a domain. Logged by
                    /cmds/xtra/_sponsor. Note that sponsoring someone in
                    a domain only puts them at the entry level. All level
                    changes above that are logged in promotes.

suicides            Logs all use of the suicide command (/cmds/std/_suicide)

top_user_list       Top 25 list of users, ranked by total number of skill
                    points. Also lists total number of active users.
                    Modified by /adm/daemons/topuserd.

workrooms           Logs the creation of new workrooms (/cmds/xtra/_sponsor)

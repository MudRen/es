A key is any object which sets the key recognition properties, that may be
used to open locks on objects and doors. To make on object into a key, use
the following properties:

    1)  set "to_lock" from create with the string you want.
    2)  set "lock_turn" from create with the amount you want it to
        turn your lock (amount of difficulty by which to lower the lock.
        Usually the same as "max_lock" of the lock.)


  "to_lock"
  
      The string that is checked by a lock when trying to change the
      lock's state.  Try to make this string unique, so that other
      wizards don't accidentally make a key that fits your lock.
        If you set this string to "skeleton", it should open nearly any
        lock.
  
  
  "lock_turn"
  
      The amount of difficulty this key reduces the lock it fits 
      by.  For example, say you have a lock with a difficulty ("lock")
      of 50.  If your key only has a "lock_turn" of 25, the player will
      have to turn the key twice to either completely unlock or lock the
      item.  Say, on the other hand, that the locked item has a changed
      lock_func() which will only let a key with a "to_lock" of "First"
      turn the lock halfway, and will only let a key with a "to_lock"
      of "Second" to turn it the rest of the way if it's first been
      turned by the "First" key.   (:


See?  That wasn't so painful, now was it?  (:

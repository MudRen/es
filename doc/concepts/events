	The TMI mudlib comes equipped with an event system which allows
wizards to schedule specific events to occur at preset times. It is possible
to have an event only occur once, hourly, daily, or weekly. The event 
daemon allows a call_other to be scheduled to a specified file/object
with an optional argument. This system is very useful for scheduling a
mud shutdown daily at 5 am, for example, or a weekly purge of inactive
users from the database.
	The events are stored in a data file and the event queue is
restarted at each mud reboot. Only root/admin permitted users may schedule
an event call to a root object/file. This prevents misuse of the daemon
to bypass mudlib permission systems.
	Events are scheduled with the use of the "event" mudlib wizard
command, which allows additions, removals, and listings of all pending
event calls within the event queue.

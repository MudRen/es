   This directory contains documents which describe the various features
of the MUD: eg, the magic system, the skill system, the virtual room
grid, etc. They describe what the objects are and how they work together
in a general sense rather than discussing the code specifically.
   lfun documents are found in /doc/functions/lfuns.

This directory stores lists of the commonly used properties in each object
plus a short description of what they do. Not every object which uses
properties is listed: however, other property-using objects don't use more
than a few, and explain those properties in the comments in the code for
the object.

It is probably in your VAST interest to keep these lists up to date as you
add more properties to your mudlib objects.

                     Common Properties used by Weapons.
                     ----------------------------------
Weapons use all of the common properties defined by standard objects. In
addition, they use the following properties:

"weapon_class"
--------------
The weapon_class means the quality of the weapon. A weapon with higher
weapon_class can always have better hitting chance than those with lower
weapon class.


"min_damage"  &  "max_damage"
-----------------------------
These two value indicate the damage range of this weapon. The damage a 
weapon can inflict is min_damage plus a random number ranged from 0 to
max_damage - min_damage.


"type"
------
Property type is a string which controls the skill to be used in attacks made
with the weapon. In the default mudlib, a weapon of <type> uses the skill
"<type> weapons" in its attacks. If you change the skill system you will need
to tweak this also.

"second"
--------
 second is an integer. If second=1, the weapon can be used as the 
second of two weapons. Otherwise, it can only be the first of two weapons.


"nosecond"
----------
 nosecond is an integer. If nosecond=1, then players may not use
a second weapon or shield with this weapon (ie, it is two-handed).


"wield_func"
------------
 wield_func is a string: if it is defined, then the function
by that name will be called immediately after the weapon is wielded.


"unwield_func"
--------------
 unwield_func is a string: if defined, the function by that
name will be called immediately after the weapon is unwielded.


"wielded"
---------
 wielded is an integer which is 1 if the weapon is being wielded by
a player and 0 if not. You should not set this property directly,
call wield_weapon instead to equip a monster with a weapon.


"bleeding"
----------
 The chance a weapon to cause bleeding condition on its victim. Don't
 set this chance over 25% or it will be very powerful.

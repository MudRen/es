                       Common Properties used by Armor
                      ---------------------------------
Armor uses all the properties defined by standard objects. In addition, they
also use the following special properties:

"type"
------
 type is a string which controls where the armor is worn on the body.
Typical types are "suit", "shield", "helmet", "gloves". Only one piece of
armor of each type may be worn. There is no restriction on what this
property may be set to. If you want to, you can create a function in armor.c
called set_type() which will check what this property is set to and compare
it against a predefined list of acceptable types. The default mudlib doesn't
do this but it is not hard to add. (Calls to set("type") will be redirected
to set_type(); see the object documentation for details.)


"armor_class"
-------------
 armor_class is the quality of an armor, which acts like weapon_class. The
armor_class means how well this armor will protect you from being injured
by a hit.


"equipped"
----------
 equipped is an integer which is 1 if the armor is currently
equipped by a player and is 0 otherwise.


"equip_func"
------------
 equip_func is a string: if defined, the function by that
name will be called immediately after the armor is equipped.


"unequip_func"
--------------
 unequip_func is a string: if defined, the function by thatname will 
be called immediately after the armor is unequipped.

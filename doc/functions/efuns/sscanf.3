sscanf(3)            LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS              sscanf(3)

NAME
     sscanf() - match substrings in a string.

SYNOPSIS
     int sscanf(string str, string fmt, mixed  var1,  mixed  var2
     ...)

DESCRIPTION
     Parse a string `str' using the format `fmt'. `fmt' can  con-
     tain strings separated by "%d" and "%s". Every "%d" and "%s"
     corresponds to one of `var1', `var2'...  "%d"  will  give  a
     number, and "%s" will give a string.  The * may be used in a
     format specifier (e.g. %*d and %*s)  to  allow  integers  or
     strings  (respectively)  to  be  skipped  over  in the input
     string (without being assigned  to  a  variable).   The  LPC
     sscanf()  is  similar  to  its C counterpart however it does
     behave somewhat differently.  It is not necessary (or possi-
     ble)  to  pass  the address of variables into sscanf (simply
     pass the name of the variable).  Another difference is  that
     in  the  LPC sscanf(), sscanf(str, "%s %s", str1, str2) will
     parse the first word in str into str1 and the  remainder  of
     str into str2.

     The number of matched "%d" and "%s" is returned.

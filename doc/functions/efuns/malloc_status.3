malloc_status(3)     LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS       malloc_status(3)

NAME
     malloc_status()  -  report  various  statistics  related  to
     memory usage.

SYNOPSIS
     void malloc_status();

DESCRIPTION
     This function writes memory usage statistics to the caller's
     screen.   This function replaces the hardcoded 'malloc' com-
     mand in vanilla 3.1.2.  Note that  the  output  produced  by
     malloc_status() depends upon which memory management package
     is chosen in options.h when building the driver.

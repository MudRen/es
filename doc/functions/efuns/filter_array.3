NAME
     filter_array() - return a selective sub-array

SYNOPSIS
     mixed *filter_array( mixed  *arr,  string  fun,  object  ob,
     mixed extra );

DESCRIPTION
     filter_array() returns an array holding the items  of  <arr>
     which passed sucessfully through the function <fun> found in
     object <ob>.  The function <fun> is called for each  element
     in <arr> with that element as parameter.  The second parame-
     ter <extra> is sent in each call if  given.   An  object  is
     considered  to  have  passed  sucessfully through <fun> (and
     hence is included in the return array) if <fun>  returns  1.
     If <arr> is not an array, then 0 will be returned.

get_char(3)          LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS            get_char(3)

NAME
     get_char - causes next character of input to be  sent  to  a
     specified function

SYNOPSIS
     varargs void get_char(string fun, int flag, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     Enable next character of user input to be sent to the  local
     function  `fun' as an argument. The input character will not
     be parsed by the driver.

     Note that get_char is  non-blocking  which  means  that  the
     object  calling  get_char  does not pause waiting for input.
     Instead the object continues to execute any statements  fol-
     lowing the input_to.  The specified function

     If "get_char()" is called more than once in the same  execu-
     tion, only the first call has any effect.

     If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line  given  by
     the  player  will  not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
     (this is useful for collecting passwords).

     The function 'fun' will be called with the user input as its
     first argument (a string). Any additional arguments supplied
     to input_to will be passed on to

BUGS
     Please note that get_char has a significant bug in MudOS 0.9
     and  earlier.   On many systems with poor telnet negotiation
     (read:  almost  every  major  workstation  on  the  market),
     get_char  makes  screen  output behave strangely.  It is not
     recommended for common usage  throughout  the  mudlib  until
     that bug is fixed.  (it is currently only known to work well
     for users connecting from NeXT computers)

notify_fail(3)       LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS         notify_fail(3)

NAME
     int notify_fail(string str);

DESCRIPTION
     Store `str' as the error message to be returned  instead  of
     the  default message `What?'.  The message will be displayed
     if a 0 is returned from an action  setup  via  add_action().
     This is the preferred way to display error messages since it
     allows other objects a chance to respond to  the  same  verb
     (command).   Do not use write() to display the error message
     since this will require you to return a 1 (unless  you  want
     to  see the result of the write() in addition to the 'What?'
     message).  However, if you do return  a  1,  then  no  other
     objects will get a chance to respond to the user command.

     If "notify_fail()" is called more than once, only  the  last
     call will have an effect.

     The idea behind this function is to allow better error  mes-
     sages than `What?'.

RETURN VALUE
     notify_fail() always returns 0.

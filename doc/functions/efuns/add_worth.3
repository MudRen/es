add_worth(3)         LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS           add_worth(3)

NAME
     add_worth() - credit an object with additional "worth"

SYNOPSIS
     void add_worth(int worth, object ob);

DESCRIPTION
     add_worth credits an object with having a  certain  "worth".
     This  worth  could  represent  whatever  you  as  the mudlib
     administrator are interested in keeping track of, since  the
     end  result  is  that  the  objects's  domain and author get
     credited with this object's additional "worth", which  shows
     up in the domain and author statistics.

     A common use for add_worth is to monitor how  much  "wealth"
     is  created  in  a  certain  area.  This is to monitor which
     areas might have too little or too much  "wealth"  available
     in them.

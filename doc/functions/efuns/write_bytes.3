write_bytes(3)       LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS         write_bytes(3)

NAME
     write_bytes() - writes a contiguous series  of  bytes  to  a
     file

SYNOPSIS
     int write_bytes(string path, int start, string series);

DESCRIPTION
     This function writes the bytes in  'series'  into  the  file
     named  by  'path'  beginning  at  byte # 'start'.  Note that
     (start + strlen(read_file(path))) must not be past  the  end
     of the file 'path' or write_bytes() will fail.  It returns 0
     upon failure, 1 otherwise.

NAME
     seteuid() - set the effective user id (euid) of an object

SYNOPSIS
     int seteuid(string str);

DESCRIPTION
     Set effective uid to  `str'.   valid_seteuid()  in  master.c
     controls which values the euid of an object may be set to.

     When this value is 0, then the current object's uid  can  be
     changed by export_uid(), and only then.

     But, when the value is 0, no objects can be loaded or cloned
     by this object.

SEE ALSO
     export_uid(3), geteuid(3), seteuid(3).

save_object(3)       LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS         save_object(3)

NAME
     save_object() - save the values of variables  in  an  object
     into a file

SYNOPSIS
     int save_object(string name, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
     Save all values of non-static variables in  this  object  in
     the  file `name'.  valid_write() in the master object deter-
     mines whether this is allowed.  If the optional second argu-
     ment  is  1, then variables that are zero (0) are also saved
     (normally, they aren't).  Object variables always save as 0.

RETURN VALUE
     save_object() returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.

SEE ALSO
     restore_object(3).

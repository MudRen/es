function_profile(3)  LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS    function_profile(3)

NAME
     function_profile() - get function profiling information  for
     an object

SYNOPSIS
     mixed *function_profile(object ob);

DESCRIPTION
     Returns  function  profiling  information   for   `ob',   or
     this_object() if `ob' is not specified.  This is only avail-
     able if  the  driver  was  compiled  with  PROFILE_FUNCTIONS
     defined.

RETURN VALUE
     An array of mappings is returned, one for each  function  in
     `ob', the format of the mapping is:
            ([ "name"     : name_of_the_function,
               "calls"    : number_of_calls,
               "self"      :  cpu_time_spent_in  self,     /*  in
     microseconds */
               "children"  :  cpu_time_spent_in_children  /*   in
     microseconds */
            ])

     The usefulness of this is tied to the resolution of the  CPU
     clock--even though the units are microseconds, the CPU timer
     resolution is often much less

enable_commands(3)   LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS     enable_commands(3)

NAME
     enable_commands() - allow object to use 'player' commands

SYNOPSIS
     void enable_commands( void );

DESRIPTION
     enable_commands() marks this_object() as  a  living  object,
     and  allows  it  to use commands added with add_action() (by
     using command()).  When  enable_commands()  is  called,  the
     driver  also  looks for the local function catch_tell(), and
     if found, it will call it every time a  message  (via  say()
     for example) is given to the object.

BUGS
     Do not call this function in any other place  than  create()
     or strange things will likely occur.

SEE ALSO
     this_object(3),   living(3),   add_action(3),    command(3),
     catch_tell(l), say(3), create(l)

NAME
     socket_connect() - initiate a connection on a socket

SYNOPSIS
     #include <socket.h>
     #include <socket_errors.h>

     int socket_connect(int s, string address, string read_callback,
     string write_callback)

DESCRIPTION
     The argument s is a socket. s must be either a  STREAM  mode
     or  a  MUD  mode socket. address is the address to which the
     socket will attempt to connect.  address  is  of  the  form:
     "127.0.0.1 23"

     The argument read_callback is the name of a function for the
     driver  to call when the socket gets data from its peer. The
     read callback should follow this format:

          void read_callback(int fd, mixed message)

     Where fd is the socket which received the data, and  message
     is the data which was received.

     The argument write_callback is the name of  a  function  for
     the  driver  to  call when the socket is ready to be written
     to. The write callback should follow this format:

          void write_callback(int fd)

     Where fd is the socket which is ready to be written to.

          EESUCCESS on success.

          a negative value indicated below on error.

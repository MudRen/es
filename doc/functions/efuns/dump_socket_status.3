dump_socket_status(3)LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS  dump_socket_status(3)

NAME
     dump_socket_status() - display the status of each LPC socket

SYNOPSIS
     void dump_socket_status( void );

DESCRIPTION
     dump_socket_status() is a diagnostic facility which displays
     the  current  status  of all LPC sockets configured into the
     MudOS driver.  It is useful for debugging LPC sockets appli-
     cations.  Each row in the output corresponds to a single LPC
     socket.  The first row corresponds to LPC socket  descriptor
     0,  the  second row, 1, etc.  The total number of sockets is
     configured when the driver is built.

     The first column "Fd" is the operating system file  descrip-
     tor  associated with the LPC socket.  "State" is the current
     operational state of the LPC socket.  "Mode" is  the  socket
     mode,  which  is  passed  as an argument to socket_create().
     The local and remote addresses are the Internet address  and
     port  numbers  in  Internet dot notations.  '*' indicates an
     address or which is 0.  N.B. LPC sockets  that  are  in  the
     CLOSED  state  are  not currently in use; therefore the data
     displayed for that socket may be idiosyncratic.

     The following output was generated  on  Portals,  where  the
     only  socket  application running at the time was MWHOD.  It
     indicates that two  sockets  are  current  in  use,  one  is
     listening  for  connection requests on a STREAM mode socket.
     The other is waiting for incoming data on  a  DATAGRAM  mode
     socket.

     Fd    State      Mode      Local Address      Remote Address
     --  ---------  --------  -----------------  ------------------
     13   LISTEN     STREAM   *.6889             *.*
     14    BOUND    DATAGRAM  *.6888             *.*
     -1    CLOSED      MUD    *.*                *.*

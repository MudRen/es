destruct(3)          LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS            destruct(3)

NAME
     destruct() - remove an object from the games

SYNOPSIS
     void destruct(object ob);

DESCRIPTION
     Completely destroy and remove object `ob'. After the call to
     destruct(),  no global variables will exist any longer, only
     local, and arguments.  If `ob' is  this_object(),  execution
     will continue, but it is best to return a value immediately.

SEE ALSO
     clone_object(3)

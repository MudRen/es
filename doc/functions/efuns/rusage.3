NAME
     rusage() - reports information gathered by  the  getrusage()
     system call

SYNOPSIS
     mapping rusage();

DESCRIPTION
     This efun collects information gathered via the  getrusage()
     system  call.  Read the getrusage() man page for more infor-
     mation on what information will be collected.  Some  systems
     do  not  have  the  getrusage()  system call but do have the
     times() system call.  On those  systems,  only  "utime"  and
     "stime"  will  be  available.   Times  are  reported in mil-
     liseconds.

     Here is an example usage of rusage():

       void
       create()
       {
           mapping info;

           info = rusage();
           write("user time = " + info["utime"] + "ms0);
           write("system time = " + info["stime"] + "ms0);
       }

     The available fields are:

          utime, stime,  maxrss,  ixrss,  idrss,  isrss,  minflt,
          majflt,  nswap, inblock, oublock, msgsnd, msgrcv, nsig-
          nals, nvcsw, nivcsw.

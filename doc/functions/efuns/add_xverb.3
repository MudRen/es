add_xverb(3)         LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS           add_xverb(3)

NAME
     add_xverb() - add a verb that  doesn't  require  a  trailing
     separate space

SYNOPSIS
     void add_xverb(string str);

DESCRIPTION
     Similar to add_verb except that the verb is recognized  even
     if  not  separated from the rest of the sentence by a space.
     This function is useful when implementing the usual abbrevi-
     ation ' for say and : for emote.

     This function is now obsolete  as  the  verb  can  be  given
     directly with add_action(). add_xverb() remains for compati-
     bility.

SEE ALSO
     add_action(3), add_verb(3).

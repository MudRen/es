children(3)          LPC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS            children(3)

NAME
     children() - returns an array of objects cloned from a given
     object.

SYNOPSIS
     object *children(string name);

DESCRIPTION
     This efunction returns an array of objects  that  have  been
     cloned  from  the  file  named  by 'name'.  A typical use of
     children() is to find all objects that have been cloned from
     the player object.  For example:

          object *list;

          list = children("/obj/player");

     This lets you find all players (both netdead and interactive
     whereas users() only reports interactive players).

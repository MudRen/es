NAME
     connect - returns a pointer to the user (player)  object  to
     the driver

SYNOPSIS
     object connect();

DESCRIPTION
     The driver calls connect() in the master object  whenever  a
     new  user logs into the driver.  The object returned by con-
     nect() is used as the initial user object.  Note that it  is
     possible  to  use exec(3) to switch the user connection from
     the initial user object to some other object.

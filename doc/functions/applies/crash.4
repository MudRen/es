CRASH(4)         DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES           CRASH(4)

NAME
     crash - function in master that is called in the  event  the
     driver crashes

SYNOPSIS
     void  crash(string  crash_message,   object   command_giver,
     object current_object);

DESCRIPTION
     The driver calls crash() in master in  the  event  that  the
     driver  crashes  (segmentation fault, bus error, etc).  This
     function offers a way to shutdown the mudlib  (safe  players
     and  other  important  data)  before the driver crashes.  It
     also lets you log various useful information  such  as  what
     signal  crashed  the driver, what object was active, who the
     current player was etc.

EPILOG(4)        DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES          EPILOG(4)

NAME
     epilog - returns an array of the filenames of the objects to
     be preloaded.

SYNOPSIS
     string *epilog();
     void preload(string filename);

DESCRIPTION
     The driver calls epilog() in master after the master  object
     has been loaded.  Mudlibs typically use epilog to initialize
     data structures in master (such  as  security  tables  etc).
     epilog()   should   returns  an  array  of  filenames  which
     correspond  to  objects  that  the  mudlib  wants  to   have
     preloaded;  that is, loaded before the first player logs in.
     For each filename returned in the  array,  the  driver  will
     called preload(filename) in master.

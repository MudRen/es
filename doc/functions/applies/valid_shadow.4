VALID_SHADOW(4)  DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES    VALID_SHADOW(4)

NAME
     valid_shadow - controls which objects can be shadowed

SYNOPSIS
     int valid_shadow(object ob);

DESCRIPTION
     When an object attempts to shadow `ob'  (with  the  shadow()
     efun),  valid_shadow  in  the  master object is called.  One
     object  parameter  is  passed,  which  is  the  object  that
     previous_object()  is  attempting to shadow.  valid_shadow()
     should return 0 if the shadow should not  be  permitted,  in
     which  case  the  shadow()  call will return 0 and fail.  If
     valid_shadow() returns 1, the shadow is allowed.

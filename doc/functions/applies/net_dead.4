NET_NEAD(4)      DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES        NET_NEAD(4)

NAME
     net_dead - called by the MudOS driver  when  an  interactive
     object drops its connection

SYNOPSIS
     void net_dead();

DESCRIPTION
     If an interactive object (i.e. the player  object)  suddenly
     loses  its  connection  (i.e.  it goes "net dead"), then the
     driver calls this function on that object giving it a chance
     to  clean  up,  notify  its  environment etc.  Be aware that
     functions that depend on the object being  interactive  will
     not work as expected.

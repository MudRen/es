RECEIVE_MESSAGE(4)DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES RECEIVE_MESSAGE(4)

NAME
     receive_message - provides the interface used by the message
     efun.

SYNOPSIS
     void receive_message(string class, string message);

DESCRIPTION
     The message() efun calls this method in the  player  object.
     The  class parameter is typically used to indicate the class
     (say, tell, emote, combat, room  description,  etc)  of  the
     message.  The receive_message() apply together with the mes-
     sage() efun can provide a  good  mechanism  for  interfacing
     with a "smart" client.

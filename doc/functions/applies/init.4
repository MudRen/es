INIT(4)          DEVICES AND MUDLIB INTERFACES            INIT(4)

NAME
     init - function in an object called by move_object() to ini-
     tialize verb/actions

SYNOPSIS
     void init();

DESCRIPTION
     When the mudlib moves an object "A"  inside  another  object
     "B",  the driver (the move_object() efunction) does the fol-
     lowing:

     1.   if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in "B"

     2.   causes each living object in the inventory  of  "B"  to
          call  init() in "A".  regardless of whether "A" is liv-
          ing or not.

     3.   if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in each
          object in the inventory of "B".

     Note:  an   object   is   considered   to   be   living   if
     enable_commands(3) has been called by that object.

     Typically, the init(4) function in an object is used to call
     add_action(3) for each command that the object offers.

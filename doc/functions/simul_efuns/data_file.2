DATA_FILE(2)              SYSTEM CALLS               DATA_FILE(2)

NAME
     data_file - "returns a path name for an object

SYNOPSIS
     string data_file(object obj);

DESCRIPTION
     Returns an almost complete pathname for a file in which  obj
     may  be  stored.  ("Almost complete" means it lacks the ".o"
     suffix at the  end.)   For  example,  assuming  DATA_DIR  is
     defined   to   be   "/data",   and   obj  refers  to  object
     "/user#1081", whose uid is "Ichabod", then
          data_file(obj) will return "/data/user/ichabod".

SEE ALSO

GET_CHAR(2)               SYSTEM CALLS                GET_CHAR(2)

NAME
     get_char - "temporary patch to  allow  use  of  get_char  on
     platforms where it hasn't yet been implemented.

SYNOPSIS
     varargs void get_char (string fun, int flag);

DESCRIPTION
     This simul_efun is a temporary patch, written by Wayfarer to
     deal with the fact that the get_char efun is not implemented
     on all platforms yet.  It checks to see if the get_char efun
     is  defined,  and  calls  efun::get_char(fun, flag) if it is
     defined; otherwise it just calls input_to(fun, flag)

SEE ALSO
     get_char(3), input_to(3).

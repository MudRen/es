   IWRAP(2)               SIMULATED EFUNS                 IWRAP(2)

   NAME
        iwrap - wraps with indentation of second line onward.

   SYNOPSIS
        varargs string wrap(string str, int width);

   DESCRIPTION
        Given a string str, iwrap returns a string which has the
        second and successive lines indented.  The function iwrap
        can also accept the arguments width, and indent.  The
        argument width specifies the width of the line, less the
        indent, while indent specifies how much to indent the
        second and succesive strings.  The default width is 71,
        and the default indent is 4, for a total default line
        width of 75.

        Example:

        iwrap("Cheaters: Winkin, Blinkin, and Nod.0, 20, 9);

        returns:

        "Cheaters: Winkin, Blinkin,           and Nod.0

        IMPORTANT: Due to an apparent bug in sprintf,  this  routine
        will  REPLACE  characters  in  the   string   with   newline
        characters   instead    of    just    inserting    newlines,
        i.e. write(wrap("1234567890", 5)); will print out

        12345 7890

        (the "6" was replaced by newline) instead of

        12345 67890

   SEE ALSO
        sprintf();

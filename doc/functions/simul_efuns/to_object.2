TO_OBJECT(2)              SYSTEM CALLS               TO_OBJECT(2)

NAME
     to_object - "converts a string to the corresponding object

SYNOPSIS
     object to_object(mixed target);

DESCRIPTION
     (The following description is taken from Truilkan's comments
     in the source file.)

     Purpose: Converts a string into the  object  it  represents.
     This object
      is intended to be used as a parser by those wizard commands
     that need
      to refer to objects by various  means  (such  as  dest  and
     trans).

     to_object() returns the object that a  given  string  refer-
     ences.     Strings    are    of   the   form   'object'   or
     'object@environment' where environment can also  be  of  the
     form  'object@environment'.   object may also be of the form
     'e(object)' which refers to the environment of object.

     object may optionally be prefixed with one of the  following
     symbols:

      !  (what follows names an object that is not an  NPC  or  a
     player)
      %  (what follows names a player)
      $  (what follows names an NPC)
      #  (what follows is an ordinal value, e.g. #3, #4, etc)
      /  (what follows is a filename of an object)

     object may also be one of the words  "here"  or  "me"  where
     here  refers  to  the  environment  of  this player and "me"
     refers to this_player().

     example usage:

        object obj;

       // find the object which has an id  of  "key"  and  is  in
     player
       // truilkan's inventory.
       //
       obj = to_object("!key@%truilkan");
       //
       // find the orc NPC which is in the bag which  is  in  the
     church
       //

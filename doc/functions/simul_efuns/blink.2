BLINK(2)                  SYSTEM CALLS                   BLINK(2)

NAME
     inverse - "sends VT100 "blink" escape sequence

SYNOPSIS
     string blink (string str);

DESCRIPTION
     If  this_player()  has  the  "vt100"  attribute  set,   this
     simul_efun  will  return  str  with  the  "blink  on" escape
     sequence added in front and the "blink off" escape  sequence
     added to the end, so that the string will print out in blink
     mode on a VT100-compatible terminal.

     NOTE:  Do NOT use ed to edit the file vt100.c, or the escape
     sequences  will be corrupted.  (ed strips out escape charac-
     ters).

     query_idle_string -  "returns  string  describing  how  long
     player has been idle

SYNOPSIS
     string query_idle_string( object player, int verbose );

DESCRIPTION
     If a player has  been  idle  for  longer  than  60  seconds,
     returns  a  string  describing  how long the player has been
     idle.  Also returns "Link Dead" if player  is  disconnected.
     Returns  0  if player is not actually a player object; or ""

     etc.) If verbose == 1, shorter labels  will  be  used  (i.e.
     "LD", "m", "d", "s", etc.)

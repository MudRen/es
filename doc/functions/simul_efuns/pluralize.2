PLURALIZE(2)              SYSTEM CALLS               PLURALIZE(2)

NAME
     pluralize - "converts singular form of noun to plural

SYNOPSIS
     string pluralize(string str);

DESCRIPTION
     This simul_efun goes to great lengths to try and  produce  a
     valid  plural  form for whatever is passed in str.  It tries
     to take into  account  such  special  cases  as  "knife"  ->
     "knives", "ring of protection" -> "rings of protection", and
     "an ancient dagger" -> "ancient  daggers".  Of  course,  the
     best  way  to get the plural of the name of an object is for
     that object to call set_plural() from  /std/object.   Always
     use  query_plural()  to  get the plural form of the object's
     name.

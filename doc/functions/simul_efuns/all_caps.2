   NAME
     all_caps - "converts a string to upper case

   SYNOPSIS
     string all_caps(string str);

   DESCRIPTION
     This function is the exact counterpart of the lower_case() efun,
     although being a simul_efun it is less efficient.  It accepts a string
     as argument, and returns the string with all lower-case letters con-
     verted to upper-case, and other characters left unchanged.  Do not con-
     fuse this with the capitalize() efun, which only capitalizes the first
     character of the string.

   LOCATION
     This function is defined in /adm/simul_efuns/all_caps.c.

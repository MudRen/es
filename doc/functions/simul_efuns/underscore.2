UNDERSCORE(2)             SYSTEM CALLS              UNDERSCORE(2)

NAME
     underscore - "sends VT100 "underscore" escape sequence

SYNOPSIS
     string underscore (string str);

DESCRIPTION
     If  this_player()  has  the  "vt100"  attribute  set,   this
     simul_efun  will  return str with the "underscore on" escape
     sequence added in front  and  the  "underscore  off"  escape
     sequence added to the end, so that the string will print out
     in underscore mode on a VT100-compatible terminal.

     NOTE:  Do NOT use ed to edit the file vt100.c, or the escape
     sequences  will be corrupted.  (ed strips out escape charac-
     ters).

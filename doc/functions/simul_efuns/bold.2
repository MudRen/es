BOLD(2)                   SYSTEM CALLS                    BOLD(2)

NAME
     bold - "sends VT100 "bold" escape sequence

SYNOPSIS
     string bold (string str);

DESCRIPTION
     If  this_player()  has  the  "vt100"  attribute  set,   this
     simul_efun  will  return  str  with  the  "bold  on"  escape
     sequence added in front and the "bold off"  escape  sequence
     added  to the end, so that the string will print out in bold
     mode on a VT100-compatible terminal.

     NOTE:  Do NOT use ed to edit the file vt100.c, or the escape
     sequences  will be corrupted.  (ed strips out escape charac-
     ters).

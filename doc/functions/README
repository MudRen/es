This directory contains the man pages on all the functions defined by the
TMI-2 mudlib. It is also a good place to put the efun and apply man pages
that come with the driver: you might want to symlink the two directories,
or you can just copy the files over.
This directory is divided into four subdirectories:
efuns contains the efun man pages. An efun, or external function, is a
function that is defined in the game driver and can be called by any
mudlib objecty.
simul_efuns contains the simul_efun man pages. A simul_efun is a local
function defined in the object /adm/obj/simul_efun. These functions are
meant to simulate (or in some cases override) efuns. They can be called
by any mudlib object: when a simul_efun and an efun have the same name,
the simul_efun takes precedence.
applies contains the man pages on the applies. An apply is a local function
defined in a mudlib object that is called by the driver, such as create(),
init(), or receive_message(). Most of the applies are found in the master
object, and the driver will usually crash if these applies are not found.
An apply can also be called by another mudlib object if desired.
lfuns contains the lfun man pages. An lfun, or local function, is a function
defined in a mudlib object and not referenced by the driver. They can be
changed more or less at will without causing the driver to crash.

In the release, the efuns and applies directories come empty, since the
relevant man pages come with the driver instead.

Anything in this directory can be accessed by a player who types "help" followed
by the filename. For example, "help start" would show /doc/help/start to the
player.
This is where you should put most player help except for commands, which
have help functions. Don't put any wizard stuff here because players can see
it. Use /doc/wizhelp for that.

The mud has a ftp daemon running on port 8008 at the same site. You can ftp
files via any ftp utilities. Wizards can login with your name and password
as in mud. Apprentice wizards are allowed to access /pub/incoming (r/w) and
/open/<your name> (r/w) and other directories (r) except /adm and /data.

Anonymous ftp is also available. You can login as 'ftp' or 'anonymous' with
email IP address as password. Anonymous users can access /pub/incoming (r/w)
and other directories (r) except /adm and /data.

If you have any problem or any suggestion, email to Annihilator in the mud
or mud_adm@ccsun44.csie.edu.tw on internet.

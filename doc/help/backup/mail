   There is a post office in Farwind where you send mail to other players and
read mail that they send you. To get there, go E S W from the starting
room. You may "mail foo" or you may just type "mail" to get the mail program
started.

N.B. Wizards need not go to the post office, they may read mail from anywhere
in the MUD.

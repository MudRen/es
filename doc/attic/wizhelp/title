In the who command, the listing for each player is accompanied by a title.
For players, the title traditionally indicates level or guild rank. Wizards
can change their titles to any string. The command to do so is:

set TITLE <string>

If the string contains the expression $N, that expression will be replaced
by the name of the wizard.

For example, one might:

set TITLE $N is adding the the wizhelp directory.

The review command will show your current title and moving messages.

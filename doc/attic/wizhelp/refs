                    Help file on ref commands
                   ===========================

The commands in this directory allow you to do the things the scroll
object tracer does, but without a seperate object.  It also allows
you to set multiple references of any variable type and call functions
with any arguments.

  call <O>;<S>;<V>;<V>     calls function <S> in object <O> with args <V>
  ref [<S>;]<V>            sets reference <S> to variable <V>
  refs                     displays the references you have set
  unref <S>                unsets reference <S>
  eref [<S>;]<O>           sets reference <S> to the environment of <O>
  cref [<O>]               clones object <O>
  tref [<O>;]<S>           tells object <O> message <S>
  ss [<O>]                 scans the inventory of object <O>
  sc [<O>]                 recursively scans the inventory of object <O>

Any of the arguments, except reference names, can be references.
A reference is specified by a "#" before the reference names.
Arguments given in [] are optional and will default.

NB  If you want to you can do

alias gref    move $* to me
alias unrefs  call me;set;ref       // unref's all your references
alias summon  move $* to here
alias iref    call $*;query;id
alias all     call users;query;$*

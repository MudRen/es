How to examine objects.
=======================

The command 'exmine' and 'look at' are used to get description of specific
things.

The rooms can have "dummy" objects, which can be examined. It is the room
code that will "fake" an object, and supply description of it.

This works by initializing the room with
set_item_descriptions(string *names, string *descr).
The first argument is an array of strings (id:s of objects). The second
is a corresponding array of descriptions.

When the player do 'examine xxx', then 'id(xxx)' will be called in the room.
If this returns true, then the string given by 'query_long(xxx)' (from the
room) will be printed. It is the above call of set_item_descriptions() that
enables this.

If the room id() returns false, then objects will be searched in the current
room, to see if there is any object matching this id. If there is, then
the query_long(str) of this object will be printed.

If this fails, then objects on the player will be searched.

If the command 'look' is given without arguments, then the query_long()
of the room will be printed, plus a short summary of the objects inside
the room.

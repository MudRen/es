The channels system provides a simple way for a group of wizards to
communicate with one another. Channels are similar to a radio with
several frequencies (hence the name channels). There are several
channels you can listen to, and any wizard can tune a particular
channel in or out at any time. You can listen on as many channels as
you like, or on none of them. You can also broadcast a message on
any channel you are tuned to, and anyone who is listening to that channel
will hear it.

The channels that are available are:
wiz. The basic wizard channel, for wizardly subjects.
question. The channel for asking questions, and getting answers.
gossip. The channel for non-MUD related stuff.
mudlib. For things related to the wizards in the mudlib domain.
driver. The same, for the driver domain.
doc. And, of course, the documentation domain.
admin. For discussions among the admins. Non-admins can't tune this one.
gwiz. This channel is received by the muds on the UDP network.
interwiz. And this one by the muds on the TCP network.

The last two channels send messages across the network, so please don't
use them unless you really have something that's of interest to a
lot of people. They take up a lot of CPU and can produce lag.

The commands for using channels are these. To tune into or out of a
channel, use the tune command. You can

tune wiz in 
tune wiz out
tune wiz

where the last one will change your current setting to the opposite.
You can broadcast a message by typing:

wiz <message>

or any other channel, if you are tuned into it. You can also 

tune in
tune out

to tune into all the channels you have access to, or tune them all out.

You can use the show command to show all your active channels with

show channels

and you can see who's listening to a particular channel with

show wiz

or other channel name. Lastly, the channels command will show you a
list of all possible channels.

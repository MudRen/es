Ok, here is the standard weights of objects.
In the property "weight", it represents 100g in real life, which means:

   set( "weight", 200 ) makes the object weight 20.0 kg

So, you might have better weight sense than mine. However, this is a handy
reference when you are setting weights of objects:

Monsters:
   Monsters' weight is not very important - when they are alive. Since the
   corpse of a monster is set to equal to his body, you may want to set its
   weight to proper value:
   
       human (like):    600    (60.0 kg)

Weapons:
   dagger:             20 +
   shortblade:         30 +
   longblade:          50 +
   thrusting:          50 +
   blunt:              60 +
   axe:                60 +

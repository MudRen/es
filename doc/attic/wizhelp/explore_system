Each user has an explore point mapping defined in /std/user/explore.c and
is maintained with functions defined in the same file.
 
int set_explore(string explore);
 
    This function marks the player as being received the explore point
    which is checked by explore_d. Return 1 if this player receive this
    explore point for the first time and the explore point is legal.
    Otherwise it returns 0.
 
int query_explore(string explore);
 
    This function returns 1 if the player has received the explore point
    already and the explore point is legal. Otherwise it returns 0.
 
This system interfaces users via the "explored" command. See its help for
more information. This command also allows admins to make explore points
legal. This step should be performed after an area passed QC.

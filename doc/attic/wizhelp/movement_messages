When a player moves from room to room, the messages "John leaves south" and
"John enters" are printed. Wizards have the ability to override these
messages and have personalized movement messages printed.

To change the message that occurs when you move, use the set command.
Each movement message has a name, and you set the command as follows:

set NAME <whatever you like>

For example, the exit message for normal movement is MOUT. You might set
the following movement message:

set MOUT $N is blown away by a $D wind

where $N will be replaced by your name, and $D will be replaced by the
direction you move in. $O can also be used - it will be replaced by the
short description of an object you are cloning.
Movement messages MUST contain a $N within them somewhere or they will not
be accepted. In addition, MOUT must contain $D, and MCLONE and MDEST must
contain $O.
You can see your current movement messages by using the "review" command.
Default messages will be shown for those you have not set.

Valid movement types are:
MOUT 		--- when you walk out of a room.
MIN		--- when you walk in.
MMOUT		--- teleport out.
MMIN		--- teleport in.
MHOME		--- go home.
MCLONE		--- clone an object.
MDEST		--- destruct an object.
MINVIS		--- when you become invisible.
MVIS		--- when you become visible again.

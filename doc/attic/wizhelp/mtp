                    MTP - Mini Transmission Patchwork

MTP is a small program made just for one purpose: to avoid editing files
in LPmuds by using ed. With MTP it's quite easy to create files in LPmud
(e.g. by using the roommaker), transfer them to one's own machine, modify
them with the favourite editor and send them back for installation. Especially
in connection with SCCS I hope MTP to become a small but useful tool.

Nevertheless, MTP is just a patchwork. I expect it to have infinite bugs. It's
up to you to help me find them and get them out. Any bug report is deeply
appreciated and best sent to rg@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de

WARNING
-------

     mtp MUST be used EXCLUSIVELY for LPC files for LPmud. This is due to 
     the fact that disk space is *VERY* limited. Expect to face *SERIOUS*
     consequences if this rule is not obeyed. By the way a log file catches
     everything you do.

NAME
     mtp - mini transmission patchwork

SYNOPSIS
     mtp [-or] [-g<MUDname>] file1 file2 ...

DESCRIPTION
     In standard mode mtp tries to read the specified files and transfer them
     to the player's home directory in the local MUD. The attempt fails, if

     - the source file cannot be accessed
     - the connection to the MTPserver cannot be made up
     - the user doesn't exist or is not a wizard
     - the password used is wrong
     - the destination file already exists
     - the destination file cannot be accessed

     mtp accepts the UNIX wildcards in standard mode, in reception mode
     the full file name without path has to be sustained.

OPTIONS
     -o : Overwrite mode. Archwizards have to add -o, if they write to
          foreign directories.
     -r : Reception mode. The file is transferred from the MUD to the local
          machine.
     -g : Specifies the Game, you want to join, specified in $HOME/.mtprc.

EXAMPLES

     mtp room.c

     will transfer the local file 'room.c' to /players/user/room.c in the MUD

     mtp -o /doc/README

     will transfer the README-file (must be in the current directory) to
     the MUD and place it in /doc. Just Archwizards have permission to do so.

     mtp -r /obj/living.c

     will transfer the file /obj/living.c to the current directory

     mtp obj/staff.c will transfer the file obj/staff.c
     to /players/xxx/obj/staff.c


FILES
     MTPLOG
	Logs the file transfer

     ...mudlib/players/people/<player>.o  :
	File used to determine level and password (encrypted) of player

     $HOME/.mtprc
	Specifies the games to play. The "default" line specifies the game
	that is taken, when you don't specify a game. The other lines should
	be self explanatory. (Remember every game must be in one line.)

     mtplock
        Directories containing a file called mtplock CANNOT be read by MTP
        using the -r-option.

	An example might be the must useful here:

default TubMud
game TubMud    host para.cs.tu-berlin.de port 7682 wizard data password Lalala
game Nightfall host 134.2.72.157         port 4243 wizard data password no_way

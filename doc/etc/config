How to alter things:

1/ How to add new /cmds/ directories.
  Make the directory.
  Add a define of the new directory to /include/config.h
  Alter /cmds/std/_help.c, /adm/daemons/cmd_d.c and /cmds/xtra/README
  If you want new wizards to have it, alter NEW_WIZ_PATH in /include/config.h
  (and update /adm/daemons/wizmakerd.c and /cmds/adm/_makewiz.c which use it)
  You may want to alter the consistancy check in /std/user.c

2/ How to add new simul_efuns
  Put the efun in /adm/simul_efun/
  Include it in /adm/obj/simul_efun.c
  If your new simul_efun refers to any other simul_efuns, be sure to put it
    below the inclusion of them.
  Reboot

/adm/daemons/banish.c

banish.c is the daemon object that keeps track of banished names and sites that
are being required to use email to request character generation, usually due to
some past misdemeanor. It keeps these lists in two string arrays which are
resaved whenever one is changed.

The basic externally called functions are:
  check_banished_site()  - Replacing the old check_mail_site() this call checks
      the ip number-string given as its argument with any
      stored in the banished-sites array.  Returns are zero
      (no match), positive (matched) or negative (invalid
      ip number passed).
  check_banished_name()  - Replacing the old check_name() this call checks the
      name string given as its argument with any stored in
      the banished-names array.  The array members can use
      the standard regexp wildcards. The returns are zero
      (no match) or non-zero (matched).
  check_mailreg_name()  - This call checks the name string given as its argument
      with any stored in the registered-email array. The
      returns are the empty string (no match) or a string
      corresponding to the crypted password set for the
      matched name.
  banish_site()		 - Add the argument to the list of banished sites.
  banish_name()		 - Add the argument to the list of banished names.
  add_mailreg_name()	 - Add the argument to the list of email-reg names.
  remove_banished_site() - Remove the argument from the list of banished sites.
  remove_banished_name() - Remove the argument from the list of banished names.
  remove_mailreg_name()  - Remove the argument from the list of email-reg names.
  query_banished_sites() - Returns the array of banished sites.
  query_banished_names() - Returns the array of banished names.
  query_mailreg_names()  - Returns the array of email-registered names.
The final nine functions are only accessible to admin logins.

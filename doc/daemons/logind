/adm/daemons/logind.c

logind.c is the daemon object that handles all logins. It must cope with all
forms of control that admins can place upon logins, all forms of crashed login
replacement and ensure password security.

Basic entry is a call to the function logon() passing the new player object as
the argument.  Various checks are done at various times; control will eventually
pass back to the backend and input will be parsed normally (once the login is
completed and password verified). Two external modules may be called:

If a new user is being created, control will pass to the newuser daemon via
the call create_new_user() to determine sex, inside leg measurement and so on.

If banishment code is active, control can pass temporarily to the banish
daemon as names and/or sites are checked for status.

The logind daemon may terminate the login and destroy the new player object;
the backend (driver) must remain aware of this.  No functions in logind.c are
designed to be called by external modules.

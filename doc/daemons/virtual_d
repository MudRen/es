When someone tries to load a file named <filename> for which no .c file exists
the driver passes <filename> to compile_object() in master.c which in turn
calls compile_object() in /adm/daemons/virtual_d.c

The virtual_d is the first step in the search to find an appropriate virtual
server to compile an object.  It checks for, in order, a server of the form:
  ~<user_name>/virtual/server.c
  /d/<domain_name>/virtual/server.c
If it fails to find either of those it passes control onto the next step,
compile_object() in /adm/daemons/virtual/server.c

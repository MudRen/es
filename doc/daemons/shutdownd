Help documentation on /adm/daemons/shutdownd.c

This daemon is the connection between the command /cmds/adm/_shutdown.c
and the simul_efun shutdown() defined in /adm/simul_efun/overrides.c
which connects to the shutdown() efun which shuts down the mud.
(Each of those has its own help which you should read if you havn't already.)

Functions in the daemon for other objects to call:

varargs int start_shutdown( int how, int delay )
  if how = -1 the mud won't reboot.
  delay is the minutes until the mud shuts down
  this function starts a countdown.  On reaching 0 the mud shuts down.

int stop_shutdown()
  aborts the process
  returns 1 if you were successful

int query_shutdown()
  returns the time in seconds the shutdown is due at.


The daemon reads in a file of 'emotes', set by #define EMOTE_FILE
These are sent to all the users on the mud at a rate of one a minute.


When 0 is reached do_shutdown() is called.  This makes the emote daemon,
who daemon and all users save their data, before calling the shutdown()
simul_efun.

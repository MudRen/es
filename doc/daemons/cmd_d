Purpose:
  This daemon acts as an Application Program Interface for
  command parsing.  It maintains a table of all available
  commands and adds new elements when necessary.

int rehash(string path)
  used to add the commands in directory "path" to the table.

void create()
  rehashes the main cmds directories

string find_cmd(string cmd, string *path)
  looks for the command "cmd" in the array of directories "path"
  and returns the full path (minus the .c) for the command.

(These functions are explained in more detail in the commenting in the code.)

string *list_cmds(string path)
string show_cmds(string arg)
  these are used by various commands to display the commands in the table

This daemon is filled with ancient Cthuloid runes that convert helpful
innocent admins into evil power-hungry admins.  (You knew in your heart
there was a reason, didn't you?)

No, I lie.  What this daemon actually does is help with converting user
.o files to new formats when you change versions of user.c

Usually you can handle changes by using consistency_check() in user.c
but for major things connected with bodies and connection objects
this is a cleaner way to go.

You can invoke it by putting the line:
    CONVERTER_D->fix_user(str);
in login.c 's get_name() before it checks for the user's existance.

A party is a group of players who have joined together to adventure
and share the resulting exp.

party_d is used to store the information about who is in which party
and who is the leader of each party.  Players interface with it by
use of the command /cmds/std/_party.c

The functions in the daemon called by the command are:

void form_party(object le);
void invite_member(object le, object me);
void remove_invitation(mixed arg);
void add_member(object le, object me);
void disband_party(object le);
void disband_member(object le, object me, int flag);
void check_party(object le);
object *query_members(object le);
void change_leader(object le, object me);
void party_list(object le);

These are all fairly obvious and explained by the context in which they
are called by the command.

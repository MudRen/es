    I have got a copy of your ok09193c.zip recently and run it on
a 386 PC,[2~. It looks pretty nice that I can try many ideas before
doing it on my mud. However, my mud (Eastern Stories) uses MudOS
0.9.16 with some minor changes to support 8-bit characters in my
country. I wonder if you can do me a favor: Re-compile the ok09193
with these changes

    telnet_neg() in comm.c
    read_file() in file.c
    prntln() in ed.c

just make the mudos ignore those checkings of printable characters
in these code to allow ok09193c output and input PC's graphic chars.

    Thank you very much :)

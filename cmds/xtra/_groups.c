// The "groups" command - will show all the groups defined in /adm/etc/groups
// and list all members; those that are logged on are marked with '*'
// Note: in the case of the 'admin' group, which includes the root group,
// the root members will be filtered out so only non-root admins are shown.
// Written by Publius@TMI-2 - 8-05-93
// Modified a little by Artagel Aug 12 1993.  Grendel suggested that sprintf
// might handle the indenting better, and I thought that multiple write 
// statements meant multiple calls to receive_message() in this_player()
// which seemed like a waste of CPU to me.
// Small problem fixed by Publius on 8-24-93 - command did not respect
// invisibility to other wizards, so a non-admin wizard could find you
// with this command.

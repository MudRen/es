 
  This bin contains various commands that are used mostly, or in some cases
  exclusively, by admins. The separation from the normal wizard commands
  is organizational and not for security. Any wizard with /cmds/wiz access
  can add /cmds/adm to their path. Thus if a command in /cmds/adm is to be
  restricted to admin use only, the command itself will need a permissions
  check to ensure the calling wizard is admin level.
  See /cmds/README for details.

Syntax: channels
Effect: Shows the currently existing channels you can use.

To use a channel, eg "wiz", you must first tune into it.
  "tune wiz"    (see "help tune" for more details)
then to broadcast <message> to everyone else on the channel, just type
  "wiz <message>"
To see who is on a channel type
  "show wiz"    (see "help show" for more details)

There are a couple of special channels "gwiz" and "interwiz".
These broadcast to users not just on this mud but about 50 other muds.
(See "help mudlist").

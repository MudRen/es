 
  When a user dies and becomes a ghost, the range of commands they can use
  becomes severely limited. The sole commands a ghost can use are found
  within this directory. The ghost body respects this bin directory only,
  and when the user returns to life, the old path is active once more.
  You shouldn't add /cmds/ghost to anyone's path ... that should only be
  done by the death systems within the user.c code.

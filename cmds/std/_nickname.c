// Lets a player set nicknames for commonly used words. If the player types
// "nickname frog Pinkfish@discworld", then any time he later types the
// work "frog" it will be replaced by "Pinkfish@discworld". You can override
// the nickname by typing "\frog", in which case it'll come out "frog". Or
// you can use the unnickname command to get rid of the silly thing.

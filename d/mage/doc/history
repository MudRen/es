The history of Mage Guild
-------------------------
 
    About 500 years ago, a very smart person uses his great wisdom to
solve the secret of ancient scrolls of magic and put the knowledge of
magic on several stone tablets for others to study and learn. The news
spread out real quick and people from all over the world came to him
for the great knowledge of magic. The little town he lived become famous
and people decided to name it after this great mage - Moyada.
 
    As time went by, Moyada become bigger and bigger, people were still
interested in magic and the related field. They built a tower called
"Silver Tower" for storing books and all their knowledge. More and more
secrets were discovered, many words of magic were found and used, people
learned and used all kind of magic and never realized what was the uses
of the magic they learned. 300 years ago, a newly discovered earthquake
spell destroyed Moyada, buried everything underground. Moyada is gone,
and the great magic is also gone.
 
    Until 50 years ago, a travellers discovered the ruin of Moyada by
accident, people start to come to this place and hope to discover the 
secrets that were buried underground for a long time. They found the 
Silver Tower and make it a library to store all the rediscovered knowledge, 
books, scrolls..etc. Mages came to the tower to exchange information and 
news, thus the Mage Guild.

","title":"okip","time":767969034,"poster":"Look",]),(["id":35,"body":"Here's how okip works:
when you log onto the mud, the driver will try to figure out
your address. If successful, it'll know your letter address.
if not. then only numeric address is used.
that's why sometimes it read your site as numbers or letters..
some local machine (NCTU ones).. from the driver's point of view..
might be only the machine name (this is especially true when
the machine is belong to cis..) but sometimes it'll treat it as
the full address. For example: tree.cis.nctu.edu.tw sometimes 
will cause the driver to record the address as tree only. and
therefore if it reads differently next time, and you only set
tree.cis.nctu.edu.tw or vice versa, you won't be able to
login.
or, ccsun10.. for example, will be read as 140.113.4.20..
this is not exactly a bug in okip.. but a problem with
network addresses.. and how to read the data..

possible solution:
after you use okip -set now, add a couple more by using -add.
the best bet is to put ALL possible, both letter and numeric
address in, if you know.
or.. try to find a machine that gives mud driver the same
data everytime <grin>

真的吗？依我的设计，约一个小时可以再买你可以买的上限，当然之间必须甚麽
都没买..... 。

","title":"Re: About potions...","time":768284979,"poster":"Kyoko",]),(["id":41,"body":"谢谢大神的解说. 关於potion的限制在下有两点的建议:

1. 对於正常用掉的potion可否允许\马上补回? 如为了救命而自己喝掉三罐可以再买回三
   罐. 这当然不包括卖人或送人的那些. 否则依现在的上限, 不到七罐的potion不可能
   撑到一个小时, 尤其有时会有突发的危急状况...

2. 既然每人已有购买上限, 那麽药店可否取消卖出总数的限制? 要不然增加其卖出上限
   也可以. 因为有四五十人在玩, 既使现在有限制,我还是捧|买不到...

  以上两点(尤其第一点), 请大神参考看看, 谢谢  :)

Failed-->(the swamp troll is too evil to listen to you)
(the swamp troll keeps fighting)

I have a suggestion about quoat :
even a player's quota = 0,i think he can still buy potions.

But he need to pay higher price to buy,i.e. bandage cost 500 silver.
And please add a sea-food shop in Hai-wei.
I list some sea-food as following:(if need the chinese name,later)
(1)abalone,(2)lobster,(3)eel,(4prawn),(5)shrimp,
(6)caviar,(7)oyster,(8)shark's fin,(9)scallops,(10)sea cucumber.
P.S.players can't eat food with no limiting,i.e.eat a lobster will recover 50
50 hp ,but eat 3 lobster will full.

         Sincerely your mad...

µ±³õ ÎªÇ¿µ÷ ¸÷ guild µÄÌØÊâ so healer's bandage on other guild become weaker

so i think if will reduce healer's aim

or one sp--> 2 hp or more

let healer ÏñÒ»¸ö healer then  party with very like healer join :)

History of Adventurer's Guild
-----------------------------
    Since several hundreds of years ago, people had learned that a man can
die easily when he comes to a new area the first time, just by making a
little mistake. According to this, some experienced travellers started to
form an organization to help each other with sharing experiences about
how to go through rough terrains or avoid those tough monsters before being
killed.

    As the time passed, these travellers began to find more dangerous to
prove their abilities and experience. The more they got used to the
danger, the more they love it. Some people found that if they stay peace
in the towns, they become stupid and lazy. A new class was formed at then
calling themself "adventurers", they are excited with unknown dangers and
adventure.

    The adventurers played an important role at the time seeking the
eastland. One team who convinced King Yaramon III for a huge ship and 
supplies for sailing had finally landed the eastland. After they returned
their discovery to the Noden Kingdom, their leader, a captain named Daimil
had decided to make the house prized by the King their home. All adventurers
are welcome to the house and rest there. Since then, the house was always
the place most adventurers meet and chat.

    Today, people call the house in Farwind "Adventurer's Guild".

□ 在 Farwind 卖船票来这里, 这样如果你有朋友在 IRC, 你可以来「探监」

之所以会开放这里, 就是因为 ES 不能放太多 player, Mob 会不够抢...
So.. 绝对不可能让 IRC 的人到 game 里..

不是mob不够抢的问题...是load的问题..
在这里大家纯聊天，乖乖的不要乱跑..这样load就不会太重了...:)
真好..真的开了聊天室了

you silly...

1. If you just want to check your mud mail.. and ES is full, what
   is a good way to NOT wasting time trying and still read your mail?
   Post office in IRC, of course.

2. HP/MP/TP doesn't regenerate while you are here. what more should
   I say?

Please bear that in mind. <evil girn>

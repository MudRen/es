 
  This directory contains the objects for the various domains of the MUD.
  Exactly how you use it is up to you and depends on how you organize your
  wizards, but the basic idea is that wizards are divided into teams which
  work on a specific part of the MUD, and each part is a domain.
 
  Here is the definitions of domains:

  /d/std:
	This domain contains standard stuffs, such as guilds, shops, and 
	those unable to be classified.

  /d/farwind:
	This is the first town that a new player first come. So I seperate
	it as a domain. This town should be 'friendly' to explore that make
	new players a good expression of the mud. Also, this would be certain
	the place players stay the most.

  /d/abyss:
	The abyss is the intersection of most dungeons. In the background
	setting, most dungeon may be connected to the ultimate dungeon:
	the abyss.

  /d/eastland:
	The eastern land, which is a Chinese styled empire. I wish this be
	the main stage of the mud. Because the topic of this mud is Eastern
	Stories, this place should be very carefully designed and contain the
	most neat ideas.

  /d/noden:
	The Noden kingdom's realms. Should be easy to explore, lesser tough
	or aggressive monsters. 

  /d/moorth:
	The nasty Moorth Empire. The empire invads Noden within a certain 
	period time. This part can make more nasty monsters. This empire
	is somewhat milatary-oriented, and is on higher technique level.

  /d/cloud:
	The land in the sky. This is a legendary land of eastland, which
	is inhabited by the ancient tribe.

  /d/ocean:
	This domain contains the great ocean of the world and some islands
	on it.

  /d/wiz:
	This is the domains of the wizards. Not open for mortals.

Drow:

    Drows are evil creatures once lived above ground and were part of the
    elven community until they were driven underground for their evilness.
    Now they dwelled in black caves and winding tunnels under the earth.
    Few drows can be see above ground and in that rare occasion, usually
    at night time.

    They have black skin and pale, usually white hair. They are shorter and
    slender than humans. A typical drow weigh about 50kg and seldom reached
    more than 160cm in height.

    Drow live in magnificently dark, gloomy cities in the underworld where
    they construct their building out of stone and minerals, carved into
    weird, fantastic shapes. Their society is fragmented into many opposing
    noble house and merchant families, all scrambling for power. They
    believe that the strongest should rule and this is what their class
    system based on.

    They worship a dark spider goddess called Lolth, and the priestesses of
    Lolth hold very high places in the society. The positions of great
    importance in the society are usually held by female drows, and the
    male drows were often used as cannon fodder among the house wars.

    Drows have great resistance against magic and poisions, but their
    resistance against cold and fire are weak due to the heritage. They
    gain the power from their evil goddess and thus suffers from the power
    of the good.

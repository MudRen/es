// A bank card. Keeps track of how much money the player has in the bank.
// Autoloading. Can't be moved except by the player. Thus, only the player
// can pick it up if he drops it, etc.
// The actual account data is stored on the player, not on the card.
// This is done so that if the card gets dested or some such, nothing
// is lost. Only the name of the owner is kept on the card proper.
// be careful to keep track of it... :)
// The property "wealth" is a mapping whose keys are the names of the coins
// and whose values are the number of each type the player has in the bank.
// Thus, if the owning player had 50 gold and 70 sludge coins in the bank,
// the wealth property would be set to ([ "gold" : 50, "sludge" : 70 ]).
// You can put any kind of coins into this mapping you like; there are no
// checks or restrictions on the keys.

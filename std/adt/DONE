	* Added adt_defs.h, ilist.c, iqueue.c, istack.c, queue.c 
	semaphore.c, stack.c. Note the files beginning with "i" are 
	infinite versions in that the only limit to the number of 
	elements they may contain is imposed by the gamedriver. I expect 
	that adt_defs.h may move to the /sys directory. Note that the 
	adt versions that don't begin with i are more efficient (but 
	have limited capacity).

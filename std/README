 
  This directory holds the mudlib's standard object and their dependent
  files. Objects here should be ready to load, but are generally inherited
  by other objects within the mudlib. Standard clonable objects should be
  placed within the /obj directroy. Objects inherited  by only one other
  object should usually be placed in a subdirectroy underneath the inheriting
  object. As well, the main objects in the mudlib's body system are found
  within this directory and its subdirectories.

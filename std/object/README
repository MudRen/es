 
  The standard objects are found in here. There is the usual standard
  object, ob.c, which is the plain old object, and the secure object
  which permits nested mappings and secure properties.
  You usually want the standard one unless you have a reason to use
  the secure one, as the secure one is somewhat slower to use.

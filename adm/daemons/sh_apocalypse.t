The Apocalypse###
A Lamb, looking as if has been slain, appears in the heavens.
It has seven eyes, and seven horns and a scroll with seven seals.
Seven and seven are the minutes until the apocalypse.
###
The Lamb opens the first seal
A white horse appears in the heavens.
Its rider holds a bow an wears a crown
and he rides out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
###
The Lamb opens the second seal.
A red horse appears in the heavens.
Its rider has the power to take peace from the earth and to make
men slay each other.  He wields a large sword.
###
The Lamb opens the third seal.
A black horse appears in the heavens.
Its rider holds a pair of scales in its hands.
###
The Lamb opens the fourth seal.
A pale horse appears in the heavens.
Its rider's power is to kill and his name is Death.
###
The Lamb opens the fifth seal.
The riders ride forth, to slay one quarter of all who live
by sword, famine, plague and the wild beasts of the earth.
###
The Lamb opens the sixth seal.
There is a great earthquake.
The sun turns black like sackcloth made of goat's hair,
the whole moon turns red and stars in the sky fall to the earth.
###
The Lamb opens the seventh seal.
Seven trumpets are given to seven angels.
There are seven minutes left til the apocalypse.
###
The first angel blows his trumpet.
Hail and fire, mixed with blood are hurled down upon the earth.
A third of all green things are burned up.
###
The second angel blows his trumpet.
A huge mountain, all ablaze, is thrown into the sea.
A third of the sea turns into blood.
###
The third angel blows his trumpet.
A great star, blazing like a torch, falls from the sky on rivers and lakes.
Its name is Wormwood and a third of the waters turn bitter.
###
The fourth angel blows his trumpet.
A third of the sun and moon and stars are struck dark,
and a third of the day and night are without light.
###
The fifth angel blows his trumpet.
The Abyss is unlocked, and from its shaft comes smoke as from a furnace.
Out of the smoke come stinging scorpions, and their king is Abaddon.
###
The sixth angel blows his trumpet.
A third of mankind are killed by three plagues: fire, smoke and sulphur.
###
The angel Gabriel sounds the last trump.
A beast with ten horns and seven heads comes out of the void,
with a crown for every horn and a blasphemous name for every head.
As everything about you is destroyed, reality seems to fade...

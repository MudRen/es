Many of the wizard commands on TMI are modeled after UNIX commands.
This means that you can switch directories using the cd command,
list directories using the ls command, page through files using the more
command, copy files using cp, move files using mv, etc.

To list the files in your current directory, type: ls
To display the name of the current directory, type: pwd
To switch into a subdirectory, type: cd directory_name
To switch up a level in the directory tree structure, type: cd ..
To page through a file, type: more filename
Some documentation is available in the /doc directory.

Some more documentation is available in the /man directory.  You can
use the 'man' command to display these docs.

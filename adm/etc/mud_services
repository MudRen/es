# This file contains all the services known about muds listed in the
# mud-addresses file.
#
# Format = mud:service:port
# Don't change this file unless you really need to. Which means if you
# don't touch it. :) If you decide you want to have your own ports or
# offsets for the standard services (especially inetd) then every mud
# that wants to talk to yours will have to have your special port
# offsets in this file, which is good if you want only certain muds
# talking to each other, but bad if you want to be part of the intermud
# net. :)

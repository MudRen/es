#  File	 :  /adm/etc/user_quotas
#
#  This file holds the names of specific users whose directory quotas
#  are not the same as the DEFAULT_QUOTA set within the quota daemon.
#  This allows admins to give certain users more (or less) disk space
#  allotment to work with. Presently this only affects those directories
#  found within the user directory tree (usually /u/x/xxxx), but could
#  be expanded to include domains or other directory groupings.
#
#  Format:  [name]:[quota]   
#  
#  The quota amount given is in K (1/1000th of a Megabyte).  For example
#  watcher:500 would give the /u/w/watcher directory tree a disk quota
#  of 500 K or 1/2 a Meg.

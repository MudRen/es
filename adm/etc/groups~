# To define a group, simply put the group name in (name) followed by a list of
# names separated by colons.  To put a group in another group, simply put the
# name of the group in parens.  All whitespace and newlines are stripped out.
# If you include a group in another group, it must have been previously
# defined.  To end group declaration, simply have a newline after the last
# member of the group with no trailing ':'

# root
# root are people who know the account password. They can shut down the
# MUD, and do other things that may require logging into the account if
# things go awry.

# admin
# This group runs the mud.
# You should probably hold the number of admins down as low as you can.
# They have global write access, and can screw things up if they don't
# understand them. Anyone who is not up to date on the mudlib should NOT
# have admin privileges.

 
  This directory holds the code for the mudlib's "secure" objects used
  by the mudlib's administrative systems. The mudlib's simul_efun files
  can be found in the simul_efun directory. The news hold's the mud's
  welcome, motd, and news announcement files, while the tmp directory
  holds such things as the mudlib's swap file.

  Only Admin or Root access systems may write in these directories, and
  making them read protected, as well, is up to the admin's preference.

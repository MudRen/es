// This object is invisible to players, though not to wizards.
// If a player becomes aware of its existence somehow, he can pick it
// up and drop it and sell it and so on, and it will show up on his
// inventory list, marked "invisible".
// Probably this item isn't too useful, but you should be able to think
// of all kinds of uses for invisible items in your own game.
